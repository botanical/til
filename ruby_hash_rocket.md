### Ruby's Hash Rocket

In Ruby, the **hash rocket**, `=>`, is used to create hashes. In other languages, the `=>` operator is present in other programming languages and is referred to as the *fat comma*. 

Here is an example from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_comma)

```ruby
# Old syntax
old_hash = { :name => 'Ruby', :influences => ['Perl', 'Python', 'Smalltalk'] }

# New syntax (Ruby >= 1.9)
new_hash = { name: 'Ruby', influences: ['Perl', 'Python', 'Smalltalk'] }
```
