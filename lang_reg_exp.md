#### Regular Expressions 

A `regular expression` is a sequence of characters which define a search pattern. Every character in a regular expression is
either a metacharacter or a regular character. Metacharacters have special meanings and regulat characters have literal meanings. 

An example of metacharacters are `Anchors`. Anchors do not match any specific character but, instead, match a position before,
after, or between characters. They are used to "anchor" the regular expression match at a certain position. Here are examples of
anchors:
* `^` matches the beginning of a line
* `$` matches the end of a line
* `\A` matches the beginning of a string
* `\Z` matches the end of a string
