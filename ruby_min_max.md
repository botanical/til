#### Ruby's MinMax Operator

Ruby's `minmax()` operator is a part of the `Enumerable` class. It returns an array containing two elements which are the minimum and maximum value of the enumerable. Here is an example:

```Ruby
a = ["chihuahua", "chicken", "cow"]
puts a.minmax()
```
will give you `["chicken", "cow]`
