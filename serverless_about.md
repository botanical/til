### Serverless Computing

What Is It?

Serverless computing, also referred to as "serverless", is an execution model (something that specifies how work will happen)
where the cloud provider, like AWS, is in charge of executing some code by dynamically allocating the resources and only
charging for the amount of resources required to run that code.
