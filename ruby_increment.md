### Ruby's Increment Operator

Ruby has no pre or post increment operators that you may find in other langauges which look similar to this: `x++` or `++x`. In other words, `++` or `--` are not reserved operators in Ruby and, in order to increment a variable, one must do 
```Ruby
x += 1
```
and, similarly, to decrement
```Ruby
x -= 1
```
