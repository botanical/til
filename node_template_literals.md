#### Template Literals in Node JS

Template literals are strings that allow for embedded expressions. Template literals in Node JS are created with the back tick
character *`*. If you want to template a string using a variable, it would look something like this:
```node
var name = 'J';
console.log(`Hi, my name is ${name}`);
```
